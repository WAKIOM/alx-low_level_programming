1. `0-positive_or_negative.c` -  This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
2. `1-last_digit.c` - The output of the program should be:
+ The string `Last digit of`, followed by
`n`, followed by
the string is, followed by
+ if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
+ if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
+ if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
3. `2-print_alphabet.c` - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line using putchar
4. `3-print_alphabets.c` - a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line
5. `4-print_alphabt.c` - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Print all the letters except q and e
6. `5-print_numbers.c` - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7. `6-print_numberz.c` - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char. You can only use the putchar function and use it only twice
8. `7-print_tebahpla.c` - Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line using the Putchar function twice only 
9. `8-print_base16.c` - Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
You can only use the putchar and use it twice only
10. `9-print_comb.c` -  a program that prints all single-digit numbers separated by , and space using only putchar and not char.
11. `100-print_comb3.c` - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
12. `101-print_comb4.c` -  a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
+ Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
+ The three digits must be different
+ 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
+ Print only the smallest combination of three digits
+ Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
+ You can only use the putchar function 
13. `102-print_comb5.c`-  a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

+ The numbers should range from 0 to 99
+ The two numbers should be separated by a space
+ All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
+ The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
+ The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
+ 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
+ You can only use the putchar
